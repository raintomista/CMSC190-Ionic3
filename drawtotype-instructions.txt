Welcome to drawtotype.io!

This app will instantly transform a whiteboard wireframe into an interactive prototype by following these steps:
	1. Choose up to four from the following components
	2. Draw them vertically on a whiteboard using a thick whiteboard marker
	3. Make sure that there are spaces between every component
	4. Close the gaps in your drawings as much as possible
	4. Capture your wireframes in a well-lit room
	5. Avoid casting shadows on your whiteboard while capturing
	6. Once the image has been processed, you can delete or re-arrange the components according to your liking
	6a. To delete a component, swipe your desired component to the left to show the delete button
	6b. To rearrange components, drag your desired component using the handle at its right side and drop it when you are done

	7. Press the check button if you want to proceed. Otherwise, please press the cross button to go back.
	8. Once you are done modifying your components, you can now view your project as a interactive prototype by pressing the full screen button
	9. You can also export your project into its actual user interface source code for your Ionic application
